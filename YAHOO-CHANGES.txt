    MAPREDUCE-683 TestJobTrackerRestart failed because of stale
    filemanager cache (which was created once per jvm). This patch makes
    sure that the filemanager is inited upon every JobHistory.init()
    and hence upon every restart. Note that this wont happen in production
    as upon a restart the new jobtracker will start in a new jvm and
    hence a new cache will be created.

    and append or reset it. So now X=$X:y will inherit X (if there) and
    append y to it.

    HADOOP-5419  This issue is to provide an improvement on the
    existing M/R framework to let users know which queues they have
    access to, and for what operations. One use case for this would
    that currently there is no easy way to know if the user has access
    to submit jobs to a queue, until it fails with an access control
    exception.

    HADOOP-2838 Now the users can set environment variables using
