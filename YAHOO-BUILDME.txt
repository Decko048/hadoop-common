This file describes how to perform a full build of the
Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop which is based on Apache Hadoop.

Although Hadoop is mostly written in the Java(tm) Programming Language,
there are a number of native libraries written in C++ that need
to be compiled.  The following build instructions are taken from
  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease
and describe how to build a tar file containing documentation and
32-bit and 64-bit native libraries on Linux.  Before running the following 
commands, you will need to setup your build machine according to
  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/NativeHadoop

======================================================================
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/32bit/jdk
export CFLAGS=-m32
export CXXFLAGS=-m32

ant -Dversion=X.Y.Z -Dcompile.native=true -Dcompile.c++=true \
        -Dlibhdfs=1 -Dlibrecordio=true -Dxercescroot=/usr/local/xerces-c \
        -Declipse.home=/usr/lib/eclipse \
        -Dforrest.home=/usr/local/forrest -Djava5.home=/usr/local/jdk1.5 \
        clean tar

export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/64bit/jdk
export CFLAGS=-m64
export CXXFLAGS=-m64

ant -Dversion=X.Y.Z -Dcompile.native=true -Dcompile.c++=true \
        compile-core-native compile-c++ tar
======================================================================

Once each of the two builds above is complete, you will find a tar file
in the build directory.
